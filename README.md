1. What`s the purpose
2. How to contribute

## 1. What`s the purpose?
It`s a Java program that finds roots of polynomials with given degree and factors.

## 2. How to contribute?
No recommended text editor/IDE. All the source code is in `src/` and tests are in `src/TestCases.java`. Pretty straightforward, eh?

## 3. Future
I plan to extend it to a library that solves much more complex equations. This project has been created as an excercise, but if it happens to be the thing you were looking for, use it accordingly to `LICENSE`.
