## 1. What`s the purpose?
It`s a Java program that finds roots of polynomials with given degree and factors.

## 2. How to contribute?
No recommended text editor/IDE (I use IntelliJ Idea but it's really up to you, pal). All the source code is in `src/` and tests are in `src/com.korsak.rootsfinder.TestCases.java`. Pretty straightforward, eh?

## 3. Future
I plan to extend it to a library that solves much more complex equations. This project has been created as an excercise, but if it happens to be the thing you were looking for, use it accordingly to `LICENSE`.

## The plan is:

* solve more difficult stuff
* GUI (maybe)?
* Android app
* iOS app
* conquer the world
* conquer the galaxy
* ???
* profit
